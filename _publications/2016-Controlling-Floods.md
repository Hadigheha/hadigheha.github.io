Abstract
======
  Floods as natural phenomena exist and will continue to occur. No manmade project can stop a flood from happening, but there are several effective methods to reduce its risk, aftermath and consequences. This paper considers a novel formulation of the network interdiction problem with application on controlling floods. The aim of this work is to identify those arcs prone for flood, and implementing flood-control projects on these arcs, while required budget for deriving all these operations is bounded. the model is tested on a real-world case in Tabriz-Iran, and results are visualized.
