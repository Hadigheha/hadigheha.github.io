Abstract
======
  Understanding the effect of variation of the coefficient matrix in linear optimization problem on the optimal solution and the optimal value function has its own importance in practice. However, most of the published results are on the effect of this variation when the current optimal solution is a basic one. There is only a study of the problem for special perturbation on the coefficient matrix, when the given optimal solution is strictly complementary and the optimal partition (in some sense) is known. Here, we consider an arbitrary direction for perturbation of the coefficient matrix and present an effective method based on generalized inverse and singular values to detect invariancy intervals and corresponding transition points.
