Abstract
======
  Mother-infant vocalization from distance in some animal species such as bats, gulls and penguins is a basic tool to find the other's location. It is referred to echolocation or bio-sonar characteristics which is important for the mother to find exactly its own baby in a large colony. Moreover, the baby uses it to better conduction the mother in getting back to the nest without knowing its exact location. This natural fact is the motivation of the current study to devise a novel metaheuristic algorithm in solving optimization problems. The proposed methodology was tested on some continuous functions and led to promising results on convergence.
