Abstract
======
  This paper proposes an uncertain multi-period bi-level network interdiction problem with uncertain arc capacities. It is proved that there exists an equivalence relationship between uncertain multi-period network interdiction problem and the obtained deterministic correspondent. Application of the generalized Bendersâ€™ decomposition algorithm is considered as the solution approach to the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model and the algorithm.
