Abstract
======
  This paper considers a novel formulation of the multi-period network interdiction problem. In this model, delivery of the maximum flow as well as the act of interdiction happens over several periods, while the budget of resource for interdiction is limit. It is assumed that when an edge is interdicted in a period, the evader considers a rate of risk of detection at consequent periods. Application of the generalized Benders decomposition algorithm considers solving the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Computational experiences denote reasonable consistency with expectations.
